### Rating

I rate this game at 4/5.

## Summary

As one of the more popular multi-player games out there on the market, it's easy to know what the gameplay of PUBG is. To simplify, you play your own customized character through different modes of shooter combat, such as the classic mode in solo, duo, or squad, or other specialized modes that are meant to diversify the way you play the game.
To set up, usually the process is being dropped into the game and collecting all the supplies you need with equal opportunity as other players. Some modes, however, have preset guns that you have to unlock via earned XP through games played.

There isn't much of a solid story to follow through the game, since at its core it's just a competitive gun game, but the game does have a system of 'seasons' that players can engage in for about a month or two. Each season has its own story and look, as well as new additions to the game modes, so it creates a fun and competitive environment that's refreshed by a new perspective on the game.

## Final Thoughts

Having played this game for well over a year, I can say that I definitely enjoy it for its engaging play and detailed features every other month. Being able to play with actual people and friends is also a bonus, if you ignore the rude ones you run into from time to time.
The only reason I would deduct a star from its rating because it can be too complex for its own good. For example, there's a lot of mini events going on in PUBG at all points in time, and before long there's pages upon pages that you have to navigate to know what's going on. Additionally, sometimes the game modes are implemented without much thorough explanation, so it becomes hard for players to enjoy.

Overall though, it's a fun game to pass the time and play with people around the country or world.
