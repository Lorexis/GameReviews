### Rating

I rate this game at 5/5.

## Summary

This game doesn't have much a story to follow, as it's mainly about strategy. It has a medieval theme to it and like the description says, is sort of like chess but not really. The base concept is the same, protecting a king and navigating around a board, but the method itself is simple yet engaging. Learning how to play was definitely easier than I would've initially thought, and going through the games to figure it out was a fun task to do.

To play, you have a small board of 16 squares with 8 for each side. The tactic to follow is first switching pieces to suit your method of attack, then do an action, whether it be attacking the other pieces or healing your own. Each piece has little dots/lives before they're out of the game, and it's also important to never get isolated. Personally it took me a few tries to get the hang of it, but eventually I won against the AI after creating a 'battle plan' of sorts.

## Final Thoughts

I have to say that I really enjoyed this game! Going through it once isn't enough to appreciate it and I'm happily getting ready to play a few more rounds just for the fun of it.
Something I liked was the creative simplicity of the whole thing, going from the art to the gameplay involved. Everything was easy to follow and flowed very smoothly together- plus the menus, sounds, and music were quite fitting and added to the nice atmosphere.
