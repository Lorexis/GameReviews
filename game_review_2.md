### Rating

I rate this game at 3/5.

## Summary

Starting off with just looking at the cover art, I was expecting a cute, welcoming forest exploration game. Now, it was that, but an interesting and unusual twist was brought in right at the introduction. You play a character by moving the arrows, and that seems to be it.

The story begins in an ominous slide of images and words from an outside person, going through the conception of a child that doesn't seem quite right. Speaking for this and the game in general, the purpose isn't clear at all and I'm not sure if it's intentional. Based on my own perspective and playthrough though, I want to say that the girl you're playing as is someone who has lost something- physical or otherwise- and has gone to the Fire Mountain as a means to get it back at last. But it's not a journey of self-discovery, but rather brutal sacrifice and dark intentions.

Starting out, the game seems nice enough, except the camera movement and angles contributes to the weirdness of what's going on. As for the tale itself, it is just hiking. For a little while.

Soon you run into a mysterious boy who seems to be guiding your way- while also leading you first to dead animals so that you can consume their blood and essence in order to sustain yourself. Further down the line it escalates, because apparently you didn't make this hike alone. Your friends are found dead, or murdered, as well along the paths, and they too feed you.
Mixing in with the creepy vibes are the monkeys of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil, and do no evil, though their purpose is unclear.

In the end you sacrifice blood and ignore the death around you in order to reach the top of the mountain and that boy, where it all fades to white, ending with the disappearance of the girl with only a backpack left behind.

## Final Thoughts

I absolutely did not expect the strangeness in this game when I picked it, but I always enjoy spooky surprises in cute packaging.

As for my rating, I feel it mostly has to do with the gameplay and technical aspects of the game itself more than anything else. The different scenes changed between day and night at random, the health timer took some getting used to, and it was a bit difficult to navigate the game without any instructions or hints. Along with that, while I definitely enjoyed the pixel environment, it was very cramped in some places, thus making it difficult to tell when something was a path and when it wasn't.
The story itself was pretty engaging though, and while I would have personally liked something more of an explanation or answers at the end, the vagueness and ambiguity of it has its own charm.
